# buyLotsOfFruit
Problem 1 (for submission): Add a buyLotsOfFruit(orderList) function to buyLotsOfFruit.py which takes a list of (fruit,pound) tuples and returns the cost of your list. If there is some fruit in the list which doesn't appear in fruitPrices it should print an error message and return None (which is like nil in Scheme). Please do not change the fruitPrices variable. Test Case:We will check your code by testing that the script correctly outputs  Cost of [('apples', 2.0), ('pears', 3.0), ('limes', 4.0)] is 12.25


shopSmart.py

Problem 2: Fill in the function shopSmart(orders,shops) in shopSmart.py, which takes an orderList (like the kind passed in to FruitShop.getPriceOfOrder) and a list of FruitShop and returns the FruitShop where your order costs the least amount in total. Don't change the file name or variable names, please. Note that we will provide the shop.py implementation as a "support" file, so you don't need to submit yours.
